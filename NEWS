Version 1.8 (2024-08-02)
========================

* Prevent transcoding of DICOM images with empty 
  SharedFunctionalGroupsSequence (5200,9229), as this might crash GDCM.
* The built-in Orthanc transcoder being usually more stable, the default
  value of the "RestrictTransferSyntaxes" configuration has been updated
  to configure the GDCM plugin for J2K transfer syntaxes only since these
  transfer syntaxes are currently not supported by the built-in Orthanc
  transcoder.
  - If "RestrictTransferSyntaxes" is not specified in your configuration,
    it is now equivalent to
      "RestrictTransferSyntaxes" : [
        "1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90",   // JPEG 2000 Image Compression (Lossless Only)
        "1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.91",   // JPEG 2000 Image Compression
        "1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.92",   // JPEG 2000 Part 2 Multicomponent Image Compression (Lossless Only)
        "1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.93"    // JPEG 2000 Part 2 Multicomponent Image Compression
      ]
    which was the recommended configuration.
  - If "RestrictTransferSyntaxes" is defined but empty, the GDCM plugin will
    now be used to transcode ALL transfer syntaxes (this was the default 
    behaviour up to version 1.7)
